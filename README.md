The project aims to demonstrate how the IntelliJ Platform could be useful for researchers on the example of several
common use cases.

## Use cases

| :--------------------------|:-------------| 
| Mining data                | Headless plugin that extracts all methods and the corresponding JavaDoc comments from the project. |
| Running ML models          | Running ML model inside the plugin.                                                                |
